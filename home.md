# Welcome to the Pod

Escape Pod 14 began, like an escape pod would, as a lifeline to keep a small friend group connected after leaving a larger Discord community. 

Since then, it's grown slightly, and with an intention to grow further beyond a small group of friends comes the need to define things like "what is this place _for_?", "what rules should it have, and how will they be enforced?", and other similar questions. 

The purpose of this site is to lay out the answers to those questions, for the clarity both of the staff entrusted with following them and the users who are the subject of some of them.

Both the site and the policies are a work in progress. The policies will ultimately be considered "living documents". All content added to the site is synchronised back to a GitHub repository. This allows earlier revisions of the policy to be reviewed and changes to be reviewed. The GitHub repository can be publicly viewed at https://github.com/escape-pod-14/wiki.
